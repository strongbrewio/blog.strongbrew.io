This post is part of a series of blogpost on different RxJS patterns that I use quite often. Here are the previous ones:

- <a href="https://blog.strongbrew.io/rxjs-patterns-restarting-work/" target="_blank">Restarting work</a>

Now, I want to cover how you map function calls to streams. Sometimes we need to transform a function call into a stream. Let's say that we are integrating with an external library. We can pass a function to this library and every time this function gets called, we need to perform an action. 

For example, we have a date picker to which we can pass a function `dateChange` that gets called when the date is updated. Whenever our date changes, we want to perform a backend call to fetch some data and show it onto the screen. 

In RxJS code, I would write something like this:

```typescript
const dateChange$ = ...

const data$ = dateChange$.pipe(
	switchMap(date => this.service.getData(date)),
);
```

In this scenario, I'm defining `data$` in terms of what it depends on, being the `dateChange$`. Because we define it like this and RxJS is a push based paradigm, every time the `dateChange$` changes, the `data$` will be updated and get a new value.

But the problem here is, how do we get a `dateChange$`. We are integrating with a third party library that is going to call a function every time the date changes, it does not give us a stream. And we need a stream to write the reactive code we had in the snippet above.

## Transforming a function into an Observable

An `Observable` is something that encapsulates 'work' (to understand what I mean with 'work' please read the first pattern I covered <a href="https://blog.strongbrew.io/rxjs-patterns-restarting-work/#what-is-work" target="_blank">here</a>). The encapsulation here means that we cannot define what that 'work' is. Once we get an `Observable` we can no longer change that 'work'. 

However, there is a building block in RxJS were we can decide whatever an `Observable` produces and this is called a `Subject`!

A complicated definition of a `Subject` is that it is both an `Observable` and an `Observer`. I like to think of it as being an `Observable` that has no work encapsulated and where you can produce the values. So you can send the next, error and/or complete event(s).

Let's see a code example on how we can leverage a `Subject` to transform a function call into an `Observable`.

```typescript
const dateChange$ = new Subject();

someLibrary.onDateChange(
	date => dateChange$.next(date)
);
```

And that's it! We pass a function to the third party library that only emits the value it gets onto the created `dateChange$` `Subject`. And because a `Subject` is also an `Observable`, we can just plug this into the snippet we had above.

```typescript
const dateChange$ = new Subject();

someLibrary.onDateChange(
	date => dateChange$.next(date)
);

const data$ = dateChange$.pipe(
	switchMap(date => this.service.getData(date)),
);
```
Tada!

### Other ways

There are two other operators you can use to accomplish the same thing. The first one is called `fromEvent`. This one is perfect to integrate with API's that exposes functions where you can pass in a string describing the event type and a function to be called whenever such an event happens. This is ideal for DOM events for example (but not limited to as you can see <a href="http://reactivex.io/rxjs/class/es6/Observable.js~Observable.html#static-method-fromEvent" target="_blank">here</a>):

```typescript
const somethingElement = document.getElementById('something');

// a stream of all clicks on the somethingElement
const click$ = fromEvent(somethingElement, 'click');
```

The other operator is called `fromEventPattern`. This can be used to integrate with the exact example described above. The code with `fromEventPattern` looks like this:

```typescript
fromEventPattern(handler => someLibrary.onDateChange(handler))
 .subscribe(console.log);
```

You can pass it a function that receives a `handler`. You can pass that `handler` to any callback based API which will be transformed into a stream.

**Note**: If you can use `fromEvent` or `fromEventPattern` you definitely should. The way to do it with a `Subject` is demonstrated since that is the most straight forward way and works in any scenario. But, if possible, use the operators.

## When to use this

Some concrete examples where to use this are:

- When a function gets called by a third party library and we need a stream
- To transform `@Output`s in Angular into streams
- Basically most scenarios where we need a stream but don't get it from some API
